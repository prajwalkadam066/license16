# Currency Selection Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The Currency Selection dropdown was not displaying any options in the license form. This was causing users to be unable to select a currency when adding or editing licenses.

## Root Cause
The `/api/currencies` endpoint was missing from the PHP backend API. The frontend was attempting to fetch currencies from this endpoint, but received a "404 - Endpoint not found" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Currencies API Endpoint
**File:** `api/currencies.php`

This new endpoint provides:
- **GET** - Retrieve all currencies with exchange rates
- **POST** - Add new currency
- **PUT** - Update currency exchange rate

Features:
- Auto-creates the `currencies` table if it doesn't exist
- Includes 10 major currencies with exchange rates to INR
- Returns properly formatted JSON responses
- Full CORS support for frontend integration

### 2. Updated API Router
**File:** `php-server.php`

Added the currencies endpoint to the routes array:
```php
'currencies' => __DIR__ . '/api/currencies.php',
```

### 3. Populated Currency Database
Added all 10 supported currencies:
- **INR** - Indian Rupee (₹) - Default
- **USD** - US Dollar ($) - Rate: 83.00
- **EUR** - Euro (€) - Rate: 90.00
- **GBP** - British Pound (£) - Rate: 105.00
- **AED** - UAE Dirham (AED) - Rate: 22.60
- **JPY** - Japanese Yen (¥) - Rate: 0.56
- **CNY** - Chinese Yuan (¥) - Rate: 11.50
- **SGD** - Singapore Dollar (S$) - Rate: 62.00
- **AUD** - Australian Dollar (A$) - Rate: 54.00
- **CAD** - Canadian Dollar (C$) - Rate: 61.00

## Testing
Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/currencies
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "code": "INR",
      "name": "Indian Rupee",
      "symbol": "₹",
      "exchange_rate_to_inr": "1.0000",
      "is_default": 1,
      ...
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total_count": 10,
  "message": "Currencies retrieved successfully"
}
```

## How It Works
1. Frontend opens the Add License form
2. Form fetches currencies from `/api/currencies`
3. API returns all available currencies with exchange rates
4. Frontend populates the "Select Currency" dropdown
5. User can now select from 10 different currencies

## Benefits
✅ Permanent fix - currencies are stored in the database  
✅ Easy to add new currencies via POST endpoint  
✅ Exchange rates can be updated dynamically via PUT endpoint  
✅ Auto-converts all amounts to INR for reporting  
✅ Supports international transactions

## Maintenance
To add a new currency:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/currencies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "CHF",
    "name": "Swiss Franc",
    "symbol": "CHF",
    "exchange_rate_to_inr": 94.5
  }'
```

To update exchange rate:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/currencies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "currency-uuid-here",
    "exchange_rate_to_inr": 85.0
  }'
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Currency selection is now fully functional
