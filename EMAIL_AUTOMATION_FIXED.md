# ✅ Email Automation Fixed - License Management System

## 🎉 What Has Been Fixed

### 1. ✅ Database Tables Created
- **`user_roles` table** - Now created and working
- **`notification_settings` table** - Fixed and populated with default settings
- Both errors when saving settings are now resolved

### 2. ✅ Automatic Email System is ALREADY WORKING!
The email notification system is **automatically running** in the background! You don't need to click any button for it to work.

**How it works:**
- 📧 The system automatically checks for expiring licenses **daily at 9:00 AM**
- ⏰ Next scheduled check is shown in the server logs
- 🔄 This runs continuously - no manual intervention needed!

### 3. ✅ API Endpoints Fixed
- Fixed the "Check & Send Emails Now" button endpoint
- Notification settings save/load endpoints are working

## 🚀 How to Use the System

### Current Setup:
```
📧 Email Scheduler: ACTIVE ✅
⏰ Check Time: 09:00 AM daily
📅 Notification Days: 45, 30, 15, 5, 1, 0 days before expiry
🌍 Timezone: UTC
```

### To Configure Settings:

1. **Login to your account** using:
   - Email: `rohan.bhosale@cybaemtech.com`
   - Password: `password`

2. **Go to Settings** → Notification Settings section

3. **Configure your preferences**:
   - ✅ Enable/disable email notifications
   - ⏰ Set notification time (default: 09:00 AM)
   - 📅 Choose which days to send reminders (45, 30, 15, 5, 1, 0 days before expiry)
   - 🌍 Set your timezone

4. **Click "Save Settings"** - This now works without errors! ✅

### Optional: Manual Email Check
The "Check & Send Emails Now" button is for **testing purposes only**. It manually triggers an email check, but remember:
- ✨ Emails are already being sent automatically every day
- 🔘 This button is just for testing/verification
- 📧 You'll see a message showing how many emails were sent

## 📧 Email Configuration (Optional)

For email notifications to work, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use ReplitMail (Recommended)
The ReplitMail integration is already added to your project. To activate it:
1. The system will automatically use ReplitMail for sending notifications
2. No additional configuration needed

### Option 2: Set Admin Email
Set the `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable:
```
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com
```
This is who receives the notification emails.

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Server Logs:
Look for these messages in your server console:
```
✅ Connected to MySQL database
📧 Email notification scheduler started
⏰ Daily checks will run at 09:00
📅 Next email check scheduled for: [date/time]
```

### Check Notification History:
The system tracks all sent emails in the `email_notifications` table. Each notification includes:
- License ID
- Notification type (45_days, 30_days, etc.)
- Email status (sent/failed)
- Timestamp

## 🎯 What Changed vs Before

### Before:
- ❌ Manual button click required to send emails
- ❌ Database errors when saving settings
- ❌ Missing tables causing failures

### After:
- ✅ **Automatic daily email checks** - no button needed!
- ✅ Settings save successfully
- ✅ All database tables created and working
- ✅ Scheduler runs 24/7 in the background

## 📝 Summary

**The email automation is now fully functional!** 

- 🔄 Emails send **automatically every day at 9:00 AM**
- ⚙️ You can configure settings through the UI
- 🔘 The "Check & Send Now" button is optional (for testing only)
- 📊 All database errors are fixed

**You don't need to do anything** - the system is already watching for expiring licenses and will send notifications automatically! 🎉
