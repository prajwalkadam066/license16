I am working on a web application using PHP for the backend and phpMyAdmin (PostgreSQL or MySQL depending on the setup) for the database. I want to deploy this project using cPanel.

Here are the tasks I need help with:

1. Fix form submission errors:
   - I am getting "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" errors when submitting forms like Add Client and Add License.
   - It seems the form data is not being handled or validated properly.
   - Help me add input validation in PHP and ensure that required fields like client id are checked before accessing them.

2. Navbar issue:
   - I am having trouble displaying the navigation bar properly. It might be due to missing variables or incorrect PHP includes.
   - Help me fix it so that the navigation bar is consistent across pages.

3. Remove Multi-Currency Purchases page and its database:
   - I want to completely delete the Multi-Currency Purchases page and its database tables.
   - Provide me the SQL commands to drop these tables.
   - Help me remove all routes and code related to this page safely without breaking the rest of the application.

4. Email automation for license expiration:
   - I want to automatically send email reminders to clients when their tools/licenses are expiring.
   - Emails should be sent at these intervals:
     - 30 days before expiration
     - 15 days before expiration
     - 7 days before expiration
     - 1 day before expiration
     - On the day of expiration (optional)
   - The email should include:
     - Client name
     - Tool name
     - Expiration date
     - A message like "Your license is expiring in X days. Please renew it soon."
   - Help me write PHP code that:
     - Checks the database daily for licenses nearing expiration
     - Sends emails using PHPMailer or a similar library
     - Avoids sending duplicate emails by keeping a log or status field

5. Deployment on cPanel:
   - Help me configure the database connection in PHP using cPanel settings.
   - Explain how to set up environment variables or credentials safely in cPanel.
   - Provide steps to upload my PHP files and database backup to the hosting server.

Please give me:
- PHP code examples for validation and email sending.
- SQL commands to delete the database.
- Instructions for cPanel setup including database connection and email configuration.
