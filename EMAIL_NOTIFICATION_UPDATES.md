## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Configuration

### Set Admin Email (Required)
The system needs an admin email to send notifications. Set it in your environment:

1. Go to Replit **Secrets** tab
2. Add a new secret:
   - Key: `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - Value: your-admin-email@example.com

Without this, you'll see a warning: "Admin email not configured"

## üìä How Automatic Emails Work

1. **Daily Scheduler** runs at your configured time (e.g., 09:00)
2. **Checks all licenses** in the database
3. **Calculates days until expiry** for each license
4. **Sends emails** if:
   - License matches a notification day you selected
   - Email hasn't been sent today for this license/day combination
5. **Logs results** in email_notifications table

## üîÑ Real-Time Updates

When you change notification settings:
- Email scheduler **automatically restarts** with new time
- New notification days are **immediately active**
- No manual restart required!

## üìù Email Recipients

Each notification is sent to:
- **Admin** (configured via ADMIN_EMAIL)
- **Client email** (if available in license record)
- **Vendor email** (if available in vendor record)

## üöÄ Next Steps
