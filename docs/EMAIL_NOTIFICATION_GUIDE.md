```

### 3. Client Email

## Using the System

### Manual Email Check
1. Navigate to **Notification Center**
2. Click **"Check & Send Emails Now"** button
3. View results showing:
   - Number of licenses checked
   - Emails sent successfully
   - Any failures

### Automatic Daily Checks
- The scheduler runs automatically at 09:00 daily
- No user intervention required
- Check server logs for confirmation:
  ```
  üìß Email notification scheduler started
  ‚è∞ Daily checks will run at 09:00
  üìÖ Next email check scheduled for: [date/time]
  ```

### Testing the System
1. Go to **Notification Center**
2. Use the **"Send Test Email"** feature
3. Enter your email address
4. Verify you receive the test notification

## Database Tables

### notification_settings
Stores user preferences for email notifications:
- `email_notifications_enabled`: Toggle email on/off
- `notify_45_days`, `notify_30_days`, etc.: Individual interval toggles
- `notification_time`: When to run daily checks
- `timezone`: User's timezone preference

### email_notifications
Tracks all sent notifications:
- `license_id`: Which license the notification is for
- `notification_type`: Interval type (45_days, 30_days, etc.)
- `email_status`: sent, failed, or pending
- `email_sent_at`: Timestamp of when email was sent
- `email_subject` and `email_body`: Email content

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending
1. **Check Admin Email**: Verify `ADMIN_EMAIL` is set in Secrets
2. **Check Client Email**: Ensure client has valid email address
3. **Check Settings**: Verify email notifications are enabled
4. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in server logs

### Duplicate Emails
The system automatically prevents duplicates by:
- Checking if notification was already sent today
- Recording each sent email in `email_notifications` table
- Skipping licenses that already received notifications

### Scheduler Not Running
1. **Check Server Logs**: Look for scheduler initialization messages
2. **Restart Server**: Stop and restart the application
3. **Verify Database**: Ensure MySQL connection is active
