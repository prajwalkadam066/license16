# üö® URGENT: Files Need to be Uploaded to Fix 404 Error

## Current Problem
- **Licenses page shows "HTTP error! status: 404"**
- **Add New License client dropdown shows "Loading clients..."**

## Root Cause
The updated PHP files with correct CORS headers are **LOCAL ONLY** and haven't been uploaded to the cPanel server.

## Server Current State (INCORRECT)
```
https://cybaemtech.net/lms/api/clients.php  ‚ùå OLD FILE
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false

https://cybaemtech.net/lms/api/licenses.php ‚ùå OLD FILE  
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false
```

## Required Server State (CORRECT)
```
https://cybaemtech.net/lms/api/clients.php  ‚úÖ NEED TO UPLOAD
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5013
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

https://cybaemtech.net/lms/api/licenses.php ‚úÖ NEED TO UPLOAD
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5013  
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Upload clients.php
- **Local file**: `api/clients.php` (has correct CORS headers)
- **Upload to**: `cybaemtech.net/lms/api/clients.php`

### Step 2: Upload licenses.php  
- **Local file**: `api/licenses.php` (has correct CORS headers)
- **Upload to**: `cybaemtech.net/lms/api/licenses.php`

## After Upload - Expected Results
‚úÖ **Add New License**: Client dropdown will show "Client (4 available)" with actual names
‚úÖ **Manage Licenses**: Will load licenses properly without 404 error
‚úÖ **License Creation**: Will work end-to-end with proper currency handling

- ‚úÖ Correct CORS headers for localhost:5000
- ‚úÖ Complete CRUD operations  
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraint handling
- ‚úÖ Currency and cost calculation support
