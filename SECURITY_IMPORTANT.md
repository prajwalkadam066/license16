# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

## Database Credentials Exposure

**URGENT**: Your database credentials are currently hardcoded in the following files:
- `api/licenses.php`
- `api/config/database.php`
- Other API files in `/api/` folder

### Security Risks:
1. **Credentials in version control** - Anyone with access to your repository can see your database credentials
2. **Potential unauthorized access** - These credentials could be used to access or modify your database
3. **Password rotation issues** - If you change the password, you need to update multiple files

## Immediate Actions Required:

### 1. Rotate Database Credentials
**IMMEDIATELY change your database password** via your hosting control panel to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. For Future Development (Recommended Approach)

#### Option A: Use Environment Variables (Most Secure)
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Add your database credentials to `.env`
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` so it's never committed
4. Update PHP files to use `api/db_config_secure.php` instead of hardcoded credentials
5. For cPanel deployment, set environment variables in cPanel's interface

#### Option B: Create a Config File Outside Version Control
1. Create `api/config/credentials.php` with your database details
2. Add `credentials.php` to `.gitignore`
3. Update PHP files to include this file
4. **Never commit this file to version control**

### 3. For cPanel Deployment

When deploying to cPanel:
1. Use cPanel's "Environment Variables" feature to set:
   - `MYSQL_HOST`
   - `MYSQL_DATABASE`
   - `MYSQL_USER`
   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

2. Update your PHP files to read from environment variables:
```php
$host = getenv('MYSQL_HOST');
$dbname = getenv('MYSQL_DATABASE');
$username = getenv('MYSQL_USER');
$password = getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD');
```

## Current Status in Replit

‚úÖ **IMPROVEMENTS MADE:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated main PHP files to use environment variables with secure fallback
2. ‚úÖ Files updated: `api/licenses.php`, `api/clients.php`, `api/login.php`, `api/config/database.php`
3. ‚úÖ System now reads from `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD` environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Fallback values ensure system continues working during migration
5. ‚úÖ Everything is working functionally

‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING SECURITY ACTIONS:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback credentials are still exposed in code (for backward compatibility)
2. üîÑ Set up proper environment variables in Replit (see instructions below)
3. üîÑ Once environment variables are set, remove fallback values from code
4. üîÑ Rotate database password after deployment

## Next Steps:
1. Change your database password immediately
2. Implement environment variable approach
3. Update all PHP files to use secure configuration
4. Remove hardcoded credentials from version control
