## 🚀 What Happens Automatically

### Every Day at Your Configured Time:
1. ✅ System checks all licenses
2. ✅ Identifies licenses that need notifications
3. ✅ Sends emails to clients AND admin
4. ✅ Logs everything to prevent duplicates

### When Server Starts:
1. ✅ Immediately checks licenses (after 3 seconds)
2. ✅ Sends any urgent notifications
3. ✅ Schedules the next daily check

## 📊 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Server Logs
After saving settings, you'll see in the server console:
```
🔄 Restarting email scheduler with new time: 11:00
📧 Email notification scheduler started
⏰ Daily checks will run at 11:00
📅 Next email check scheduled for: 10/13/2025, 11:00:00 AM
✅ Email scheduler restarted with time: 11:00
```

### When Emails Are Sent
You'll see logs like:
```
🔍 Running scheduled license expiry check at [date/time]
✅ Email check completed: Checked 3 licenses, sent 2 emails
   📧 Emails sent: 2
```

## 💡 Important: You Don't Need the Manual Button!

### The "Send Now (Manual)" Button
- This button is **ONLY for testing**
- You **DO NOT** need to click it for daily operations
- The system sends emails **automatically** without any clicks!

### When to Use the Manual Button
- ✅ Testing if email settings are working
- ✅ Sending immediate notifications
- ✅ Checking which licenses need notifications
- ❌ **NOT** for daily operations (it's automatic!)
